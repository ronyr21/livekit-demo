# 🎛️ Admin Call Monitoring - Testing Guide

## 🚀 System Status

All services are now running successfully:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173/ ✅
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5001 ✅  
- **LiveKit Agent**: Development mode ✅
- **Admin Services**: Initialized ✅

## 🧪 Testing Procedure

### Step 1: Test Basic Connectivity

1. **Frontend Interface**
   - Open: http://localhost:5173/
   - Should see AutoZone homepage with "Talk to an Agent!" button
   - Should see "🎛️ Admin" button in top-right corner

2. **Admin Dashboard** 
   - Click "🎛️ Admin" button OR go to: http://localhost:5173/admin
   - Should see admin dashboard with "No active rooms found" message
   - Auto-refresh every 10 seconds should be working

3. **Backend API Health**
   - Test: `curl http://localhost:5001/admin/status`
   - Should return healthy status with admin services available

### Step 2: Create Test Call

1. **Start Customer Call**
   - Go to main page: http://localhost:5173/
   - Click "Talk to an Agent!" button
   - Allow microphone permissions when prompted
   - Should connect to LiveKit room and see AI agent responding

2. **Verify Room Creation**
   - Check: `curl http://localhost:5001/admin/rooms`
   - Should now show active room with participant count

### Step 3: Test Admin Monitoring

1. **Access Admin Dashboard**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173/admin
   - Should now see the active call room listed
   - Room card should show participant count and timestamp

2. **Join as Hidden Participant**
   - Click "Monitor Room" button on active room
   - Should redirect to monitoring interface
   - Admin should join as hidden participant (not visible to customer)
   - Should hear live audio from the ongoing conversation

3. **Verify Hidden Status**
   - Customer should NOT see admin participant
   - Admin can hear both customer and AI agent
   - No interruption to ongoing call

### Step 4: Test Multiple Scenarios

1. **Multiple Rooms**
   - Open multiple browser tabs/windows
   - Create several test calls simultaneously  
   - Admin dashboard should list all active rooms

2. **Connection Management**
   - Admin leaves monitoring session
   - Customer call should continue uninterrupted
   - Admin can rejoin monitoring at any time

## 🔧 Expected Admin Features

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- ✅ Real-time room listing with auto-refresh
- ✅ Room participant counts
- ✅ Call start timestamps  
- ✅ "Monitor Room" buttons for each active room
- ✅ Clean, professional interface with responsive design

### Admin Monitor (`/admin/monitor/:roomName`)
- ✅ Hidden participant join (invisible to customers)
- ✅ Live audio streaming from room
- ✅ Room connection status indicators
- ✅ "Leave Monitoring" button to exit cleanly

### Backend API Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /admin/status` - Health check
- ✅ `GET /admin/rooms` - List active rooms
- ✅ `POST /admin/monitor/<room_name>` - Get monitoring token
- ✅ `GET /admin/token/<room_name>` - Quick token generation
- ✅ `GET /admin/rooms/list-token` - Token for room listing

## 🎯 Key Verification Points

1. **Stealth Monitoring**: Admin joins without customer awareness
2. **Audio Quality**: Clear live audio streaming to admin
3. **No Interference**: Customer call unaffected by admin presence  
4. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard shows current room status
5. **Clean UI**: Professional admin interface with responsive design
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection issues

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Admin Dashboard Not Loading
- Check frontend console for errors
- Verify backend server running on port 5001
- Ensure CORS headers are working

### No Audio in Monitoring
- Check browser microphone permissions
- Verify LiveKit connection in browser console
- Ensure admin token has correct permissions

### Rooms Not Listed
- Verify LiveKit agent is running and accepting connections
- Check that customer calls are successfully connecting
- Test API endpoint directly: `curl http://localhost:5001/admin/rooms`

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The admin monitoring system is working correctly when:

1. ✅ Admin can see all active calls in real-time
2. ✅ Admin can join calls as invisible participant  
3. ✅ Admin can hear live conversation audio
4. ✅ Customer experience is unaffected by admin monitoring
5. ✅ All API endpoints respond correctly
6. ✅ UI is responsive and professional-looking
